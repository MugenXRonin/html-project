<h3>The Best movies ever! By Eldris</h3>
<h3>My top three movies of all time</h3>
<hr />
<a href= "./assets/images/LOTR.png" <h3>Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the ring</h3></a>
<p>best fanatasy adaptation of all time. Its never been done again and speaking on the extended cuts: it makes the movie so much better</p>
<a href= "./assets/images/Drive.png"<h3>Drive</h3></a>
<p>I mean its Ryan Gosling getting shit done in an hr and a half. Can't go wrong.</p>
<a href="./assets/images/TheArrival.png"<h3>The Arrival</h3></a>
<p>The ideas and motivation the movie sparked in me is one i haven't felt in a long time and well into my adult years.</p>
